# 🏆 GoalSync – AI-Powered Goal Tracking for Jira

GoalSync is a **smart Jira integration** that enhances project management by tracking goal progress and predicting risks using **machine learning**. It fetches goal-related data, analyzes trends, and flags delays—helping teams stay on track effortlessly. 🚀

## 🔥 Features

✅ **Seamless Jira Integration** – Fetches goal data from Jira issues.
